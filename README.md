# Stock Price And Population Age
A high-level analysis of the relationship between U.S. stock prices and U.S. age demographics.

## General Information
According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp#:~:text=traders%20and%20investors.-,Fundamental%20Factors,as%20a%20P%2FE%20ratio), there are three categories of forces that affect stock prices - fundamental factors, technical factors, and market sentiment. Of these three forces, I found technical factors to be the most interesting, specifically age demographics. With [reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57003722) of the U.S. birth rate declining (along with many other countries), I was curious what impact, if any, that might have on the stock market.
