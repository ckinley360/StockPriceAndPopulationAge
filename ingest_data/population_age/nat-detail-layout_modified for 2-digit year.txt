Within each file, the records are first sorted by the reference date
(Month-Year) in chronological order.  For each reference date, the first
record lists the population counts for all ages combined.  The remaining
records list the population counts by single year of age in ascending
order.



Explanation of Data Fields (ASCII Files)

Series:  Quarterly estimates for April 1, 1980, to April 1, 1990 have a
series designation of "2I", representing the year of production (1992) and
the fact that they are intercensal estimates.  Monthly estimates for 
April 1, 1990 and onward have a series designation "8P", representing the
year of production (1998) and the fact that they are postcensal estimates.

Month:  Monthly estimates for April 1, 1990 and onward designate the
months numerically.  A "1" indicates population data for January 1; a "2"
indicates population data for February 1; and so on.  Quarterly estimates
for April 1, 1980, to April 1, 1990 designate the first month of each
quarter numerically.  The monthly reference dates are "1", "4", "7", and
"10", for the first day of January, April, July, and October,
respectively.

Year: In post-1990 monthly files, year is identified by four digits.  For
example, a code of "99" indicates the year 1999. In previous releases,
year has been represented by the last two digits.  In the quarterly files
for the 1980s, year continues to be represented by two digits.

Age group:  The total population code is 999, which is the first record
for each year.  This is followed by 0 to 99, which are individual ages,
and 100, which is the population 100 years of age and over (centenarians).

Sex, race and Hispanic origin: Population data are shown for a total of 21
categories.  The first category shows the total population of the age
group.  The remaining 20 categories list the male and female populations,
respectively, for the following racial and/or Hispanic origin categories:

     Total (All races)
     White
     Black
     American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut
     Asian and Pacific Islander
     Hispanic origin (of any race)
     Non-Hispanic White
     Non-Hispanic Black
     Non-Hispanic American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut
     Non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander.
