# Data Sources

All population age data is sourced from the [United States Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/data.html). Data for different years is structured differently, and so I wrote custom Python scripts to ingest each unique data source.

- **1950 - 1979:** [Excel files](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/pre-1980-national.html). Annual estimate calculated in July.
